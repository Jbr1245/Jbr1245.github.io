    <P>Hello and welcome to my website! This space is more than just a portfolio it is s a reflection of who I am, the skills I am developing, and the goals I am working hard to achieve. 
      Here, I share my journey as a student and aspiring professional, from earning my welding degree to advancing my skills in CAD and SolidWorks.
      This site is a place where I highlight my growth, showcase my projects, and document the experiences that are shaping my career path. 
      It represents my passion for hands  on problem solving, design, and creating work that has both precision and purpose.
      I invite you to explore my story, my work, and my vision for the future. 
      Whether you are here to learn about my skills, my projects, or my career goals, I hope you get a clear sense of the dedication and drive that fuel everything I do.
    </P>


    <blockquote>
      "The journey gains meaning not in its distance, but in the determination and ingenuity you bring along the way."
