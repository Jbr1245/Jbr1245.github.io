        Hi there! Welcome to my website — I'm <span class="highlight">Jamelly Ramirez</span>, an aspiring Mechanical Engineer who loves challenges.
      </h1>
      <p>
        Here's my website that has a blend of my creativity and personality. I'm all about hands-on experience, practical solutions,
        and making things work smarter, not harder.
      </p>
      <p class="purpose">
        This website serves as my professional portfolio, showcasing who I am, what I've accomplished, and where I'm going.
        As a first-generation Mexican-American student, my journey reflects persistence, hard work, and a passion for learning.
        Here, you'll find my academic background, projects, and experiences that have shaped my identity as both a student and an aspiring professional.
        My goals are to graduate ahead of schedule, gain valuable internship experiences, and develop expertise in CAD, welding, and mechanical design.
        This site is not only about my skills — it's about telling my story, documenting my growth, and connecting with those who share my vision
        for creating innovative, impactful engineering solutions.
      </p>
