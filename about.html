      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, I'm Jamelly Ramirez, a first-generation Mexican-American student from Elgin, Illinois. 
        I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering (BSME) at the University of Missouri. 
        My path into engineering began with curiosity about how things work and a love of hands-on problem-solving. 
        Over time, I discovered a passion for welding, CAD modeling, and mechanical design. 
        These interests grew into a career vision focused on creating innovative, practical solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond academics, I stay active in leadership roles and volunteer opportunities, participating in clothing drives, 
        campus clubs, and service events that strengthen my values of persistence and community. 
        I am committed to continuous growth, both academically and personally, 
        while staying true to the principles of creativity, discipline, and service. 
        This site represents not only my work, but also the vision and drive that shape me as an aspiring professional.
