    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hello, I'm Jamelly Ramirez, a first generation mexican- american college student from Elgin, IL, pursuing a degree in BSME. 
        My interest in engineering comes from passion for understanding how things work and a desire to create a solution that is worth while, 
        worth doing and worth mentioning.
        throguhout my academic journey, i have developed many skills and expericnes that shape the stuent and person I am today.
        I have experience with different softwares. MATLAB, DWSIM, Simio, CircuitVerse, Adobe, Solidworks and West Point Bridge
        While also taking part in learning to weld again, while I had ecperience prior to college, I am looking to become certfied and hoepfully make it a skill i cam use in the future.

        I ALWAYS get complimented on my worht ethic and my ability to learn quickly, but many ask why engineering? and why mechanical?
        the answer is simple, I love to create and build things and i want more than anything to make a positive impact in the world.
        I do strongly belive that mechanical engineering is the broadest field in engineering and that will give me the most options in the future to make thar impact I desire.
        
        On top of the techincal skills I also do lots of volunteer work and leadership roles. I am currently wokring on making my resume fit me as a person. joinign all kinds of clubs and 
        organizations to make me well rounded. I am currently becoming a member of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and clubs like 
        caring4columbia , sustain mizzou and my current favorite Torq'N Tigers, a tractor pulling team and I have never been more excited. 
        I can get real experience and hands on work on tractors, and apply my skills from solid works/CAD. 
    </p>
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p>Advance my welding skills by completing a certification course. 
       Graduating earlier than the four year plan fro my BSME degree.
       Enhance my CAD/Solidworks skills, creating as many designs as possible.
       Prepare for the future by getting an internship in a valuable company.
      Recieving more hands on experience in engineering wether that be in the classroom or outside of it.
