    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hello, I'm Jamelly Ramirez, a first generation college student from Elgin, IL, pursuing a degree in BSME. 
        My interest in engineering comes from passion from getting stuck and solving complex problems. 
        It has branched into wanting to solve real-world problems and create practical impactful solutions. 
        I have experience with different softwares. MATLAB, DWSIM, Simio, CircuitVerse, Adobe and West Point Bridge. 
        Along with growing skills in CAD. 
        I bring strong technical skills and volunteer experience. Outside of academics , I enjoy volunteering in local community cleanups and have helped in clothing drives. 
        I've connected with numerous organizations and people with similar interests.
</p>

    <h3>Skills and Experience</h3>
    <p>I have experience with software such as MATLAB, DWSIM, Simio, CircuitVerse, Adobe, and West Point Bridge. I am also building strong CAD skills. These tools, along with volunteer and leadership experience, have given me a well-rounded foundation for engineering work.</p>

    <h3>Community Involvement</h3>
    <p>Outside of academics, I volunteer in community cleanups and clothing drives, connecting with organizations and people who share my interest in making a positive impact.
        I have also recently joined Torq'N Tigers, a tractor pulling team and I have never been more excited. 
        I can get real experience and hands on work on tractors, and apply my skills from solid works/CAD.
    </p>
    <h3>education </h3>
    <p>I take my education very seriously, thanks to the rigorous courses at the University of Missouri
        which have given me hands on experience and knowledge in practical ways. Building a strong foundation 
        for my future endeavors. 
        I have taken Calc 1,2,3, Physics, Intro to CAD, Chemistry, Introduction to Engineering, Foundations of Engineering, Intro to digital design.
        There's many more courses to be taken, and these are just a glimpse of the courses I've taken. At this rate I will graduate early!    </p>
