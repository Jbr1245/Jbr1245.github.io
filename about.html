    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hello, I'm Jamelly Ramirez, a first generation Mexican-American college student from Elgin, IL, pursuing a degree in BSME. 
      My interest in engineering comes from a passion for understanding how things work and a desire to create solutions that are worthwhile, 
      meaningful, and impactful. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed many skills and experiences that shape the student and person I am today.  
    </p>

    <h3>Academics</h3>
    <p>My academic background combines strong technical skills with a passion for problem-solving. 
      I am eager to apply my growing experience in engineering software and CAD to real-world projects while continuing to expand my skills.
    </p>
