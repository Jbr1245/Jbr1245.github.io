    <h1>My Experience</h1>

    <h2>Community Involvement</h2>
    <p>I volunteer regularly in Columbia, focusing on clothing drives and community cleanups. These experiences have allowed me to connect with local residents and gain valuable insight into the importance of teamwork, leadership, and service — all key to becoming an impactful engineer.</p>

    <h2>Academic & Technical Experience</h2>
    <p>At Mizzou, I've strengthened my skills through <strong>Career Services programs, engineering organizations, and hands-on simulations</strong>. I’ve gained technical experience with software including DWSIM, Simio, CircuitVerse, MATLAB, and Microsoft Office tools. I’m also developing skills in <strong>CAD</strong> and mechanical modeling to prepare for future design roles.</p>

    <h2>High School Volunteer Work</h2>
    <p>Before college, I volunteered with special needs students, helped plan school events, tutored peers, and supported local soup kitchens and creek cleanups. These experiences shaped my empathy and desire to give back through engineering solutions that help communities thrive.</p>
