    <h1>My Goals</h1>
    <p>My main goal is to <strong>graduate ahead of schedule</strong> with a strong academic record and meaningful project experience. I plan to pursue internships that allow me to apply mechanical design, simulation, and manufacturing techniques to real-world engineering problems.</p>

    <p>I'm passionate about developing skills in <strong>CAD design, welding, and mechanical systems</strong>. Long-term, I hope to work in a company that values innovation, sustainability, and diversity — where I can use engineering to improve efficiency and create lasting impact.</p>

    <p>As a first-generation student and Mexican-American woman in engineering, I aim to inspire others to chase their goals without fear. My journey is not just about reaching success, but paving the way for others to follow.</p>
