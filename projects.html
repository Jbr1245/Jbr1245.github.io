  <h2>Project 1: Torq Tiger Tractor Pulling Team</h2>
  <p>As a new member of the <strong>¼-Scale Tractor Pulling Club</strong>, I work with a team to design and maintain scaled-down pulling tractors that compete in strength and stability contests. These machines are built from the ground up, requiring detailed engineering of components such as the engine system, drive shaft, frame, tires, and hitching mechanism.</p>

  <p>Our club manages multiple tractors with unique designs that we refine over time. Recently, our team solved a stability issue caused by shaft misalignment, which made the internal wheel spin inefficiently. By adjusting the shaft height and improving alignment, we restored balance and torque performance.</p>

  <div class="reflection"><strong>Reflection:</strong> This experience gave me hands-on exposure to mechanical systems and teamwork under pressure. I learned how small design adjustments can drastically affect performance and how vital collaboration is in mechanical engineering. The guidance and teamwork within the club made learning enjoyable and inspiring.</div>

<div class="project">
  <h2>Project 2: CAD Design Projects (SolidWorks)</h2>
  <p>In my <strong>CAD projects</strong>, I have learned to go beyond creating models and focus on interpreting and analyzing engineering prints. Many assignments tested my ability to read complex diagrams with multiple views, hidden lines, and angles. A major skill I gained was determining unlabeled dimensions using geometric relationships and design logic.</p>

  <p>This experience taught me to think like an engineer rather than just a drafter. I developed confidence in reading and interpreting real-world blueprints where precision and clarity matter most.</p>

  <div class="artifact"><strong>Artifact:</strong> my work on SolidWorks and CAD models.</div>

  <div class="reflection"><strong>Reflection:</strong> CAD work has taught me patience and precision. Initially, reading prints with multiple angles was intimidating, but I learned to break them down systematically. I explored advanced SolidWorks features and shortcuts that improved my workflow and accuracy, shaping me into a more detail-oriented designer.</div>

  <h2>Project 3: Volunteer & Leadership Work</h2>
  <p>Through <strong>volunteering and club involvement</strong>, I've supported my community while building leadership and communication skills. I participate in cleanups, sustainability efforts, and Latin community awareness projects. I also use social media platforms to share accurate information, resources, and updates on local crises.</p>

  <p>Combining hands-on volunteering with digital outreach allows me to make a meaningful impact while practicing coordination, communication, and social responsibility. These experiences have strengthened my leadership and empathy as an aspiring engineer.</p>

  <div class="reflection"><strong>Reflection:</strong> Volunteering has shown me the power of both local and digital engagement. Whether cleaning up neighborhoods or sharing information online, I’ve learned that small actions can create real change. It’s especially meaningful because of my background — giving back is part of who I am.</div>
