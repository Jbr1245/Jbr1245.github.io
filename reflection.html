      <h1>Personal Reflection</h1>
      <h2>My Growth as an Engineer and Learner</h2>

      <div class="reflection-box">
        <p>
          Building this portfolio has given me the chance to deeply reflect on my academic journey, my growth as a student, and my evolving professional goals. 
          As a <span class="highlight">first-generation college student</span>, this project is more than a digital showcase—it is a representation of perseverance, 
          resilience, and pride. Creating this website allowed me to organize my accomplishments while recognizing how each challenge has shaped me into who I am today. 
          Every section of this portfolio—whether it's my engineering projects, volunteer work, or leadership experiences—tells part of a larger story about ambition and purpose. 
          It has reminded me that success is not only about technical achievement but also about self-awareness, growth, and community connection.
        </p>

        <p>
          I view this portfolio as a living document that will continue to evolve alongside me throughout my engineering journey. 
          Each project included here represents progress, not perfection—from mastering the basics of CAD modeling and SolidWorks to tackling complex group challenges 
          like the Torq Tiger Tractor Pulling project. The more I learn, the more I realize that engineering is about continuous problem-solving and collaboration. 
          Through teamwork, mentorship, and hands-on experience, I've discovered how essential communication and patience are when designing, testing, and improving systems. 
          This reflection has also made me appreciate the people who have guided me—professors, peers, and mentors—each contributing to my confidence and curiosity in the field.
        </p>

        <p>
          My career goals are rooted in both ambition and purpose. I aim to <span class="highlight">complete my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering ahead of schedule</span>, 
          while gaining valuable real-world experience through internships and research opportunities. I want to specialize in mechanical design and manufacturing, 
          mastering tools like CAD and SolidWorks to create innovative, efficient designs that improve everyday life. I am also pursuing certifications, such as in 
          <strong>Advanced Welding</strong>, to strengthen my technical foundation and open new doors in the field. My ultimate vision is to use my skills to design 
          solutions that blend creativity with functionality—whether it's improving energy systems, developing assistive devices, or creating sustainable designs 
          that make a difference in communities like the one I came from.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ultimately, this project has shown me the importance of reflection and presentation. It's not just about the work I do, but how I share it with others. 
          Through this website, I've learned to communicate my story with authenticity—to show that my path has been built through hard work, persistence, 
          and the support of those who believe in me. This portfolio embodies my <span class="highlight">dedication, curiosity, and resilience</span> 
          as an engineer and as a woman in STEM. I am proud of how far I've come and excited for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. 
          My story is still being written, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes me next.
